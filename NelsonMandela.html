Ans.
a) Nelson Mandela is a South African leader. He is famous for his 
struggle against apartheid and for opening up multi-racial democracy.

b) He became the first black president of South Africa in 1994. 
In his inaugural speech as president he urged that the time for the 
healing of the wounds and to bridge the chasms that divide the black and the white 
people has come. He also said that the black people have achieved political

c) Nelson Mandela’s dream was to free the black people of South Africa from the 
shackles of apartheid and uphold their right. He fought for his countrymen especially 
for the black community. He fought so courageously and firmly that no imprisonment and 
torturing could weaken his spirit.

d) In the court of Rivonia Trial Mandela said that he struggled against both white and 
black domination in his entire life and had a dream for fair and free society.

e) Mandela was talking about the ideal of a democratic and free society where there will 
be no discrimination and all people will get equal opportunities and live together in harmony.

f) Nelson Mandela is described as an icon of peace and reconcilliation. His fight against 
racial discrimination abolishing white minority rule in South Africa has earned for him this 
entitlement.

g) This statement was made by Nelson Mandela. In 1994 in his acceptance speech on becoming South 
African’s first president. Mandela pointed out this mission of his life.

h) Mandela got the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and his determination was to bring down apartheid 
avoiding a civil war. F.W de Klerk, the white African leader contributed much in reducing tension 
of racism and discrimination. He freed Mandela three years ago and negotiated the end of apartheid.

i) Nelson Mandela spoke these words “Don’t call me. I will call you.” In June 2004 before his 86th 
birthday he uttered these words towards his countrymen.

j) Yes, I agree with the statement. Mandela was fighting for a right cause. He was fighting against
 apartheid. Going to do this he was imprisoned by the white tyrannical govt. So in the prison Mandela 
 became the most celebrated political prisoner.

k) Mandela was imprisoned for nearly three decades (30 years). He fought for upholding the right of 
black people of his country.

1) Mandela hated racism. The way he chose to fight against racism was appreciated world wide. That is 
why Mandela was determined. His prestige and charisma helped him to win the support of the world.

m) Mandela hated racism. He hated it most intensely and in all its manifestation.

n) Mandela was awarded the Nobel prize for his immense contribution to free South Africa from the shackles 
of apartheid and paved the way for multi-racial democracy. The white African leader F.W. de Klerk shared the 
prize with him.

o) The passage is about Nelson Mandela and his contribution. Mandela fought against apartheid and succeeded to 
free the black people of racial discrimination. He became an icon of peace and reconciliation.

p) Nelson Mandela said this. He said this because he retired from his public life. However, he did not retire from 
his ideal. When needed, he would call his people again to defend his ideal. This statement shows Mandela’s life-long 
struggle against apartheid and discrimination.

q) Mandela fought against the white domination. Mandela won over this white domination. But after victory Mandela did 
not go for revenge. He sought reconciliation. Thus he prevented the civil war.

r) Mandela’s remark on racial discrimination is that he has fought against it throughout his life and will continue 
fighting to the last breath of his life.

s) Mandela aimed at removing apartheid from his country and establishing a multi-racial democracy.

t) Nelson Mandela is the icon of peaceful fighting against apartheid. He established a example of struggle for the noble 
cause of his country’s freedom. His sacrifice has inspired the oppressed all over the world. This is why, Nelson Mandela is so famous.

u) I find a similarity between Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman of Bangladesh and Mandela. Both these leaders fought against 
discrimination and injustice. Both these leaders had to spend a big portion of their life in the prisons but they were successful 
to liberate the people from oppression and injustice.
